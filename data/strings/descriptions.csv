parked_cryosleeper,CUSTOM,"A monumental vessel, now a reminder of our golden past. Domain Explorarium commissioned these to deliver millions of people safely to distant reaches of space, with autonomous guardians tending their cryosleep. Once claimed as outcasts, then praised as brave explorers, now a shining beacon of hope for the Persean Sector. It was found drifting and was carried to a stable orbit to remind us of the technological wonders the Domain was capable of.",,,
electronics,RESOURCE,Essential in production of cutting edge equipment and construction of technologically advanced ships.,,,
water,RESOURCE,"The most precious resource for anything that's alive, often treated as mundane and taken as granted, and yet many of the spacers serving on orbital stations and volcanic planets could sing ballads about how they owe their lives to the water purification systems and the regular shipments.
Even if its low profit, incompressible and a pain in ass to ship, it is one of most crucial resources in entirety of the Persean Sector, required to sustain life and used as a base for high performance reagents, solvents and so on. Stations and hell worlds will need it imported to survive.",,,
biotics,RESOURCE,"The term 'biotic' is used to describe materials derived from living organisms, but in layman terms, it's essentially a fancy way to refer to high purity extracts and materials obtained by processing organic products. Biomass-based compounds are employed in industrial chemistry, medicine, and various other fields. Natural materials, while much less advanced, are still used in construction and light manufacturing, just as they were for millennia.",,,
recitificates,RESOURCE,"Natural resources, be it various biochemicals, carbohydrates, hydrocarbons and certain metals have been efficiently extracted from substrates to fuel the mankind's industries since the dawn of civilisation. While some procedures to refine said resources from organics are comparatively modern developments, the humble yet reliable reflux reactor and regenerating molecular sieve to used to render and dry organic spirits come from the Old Earth itself.",,,
purified_ore,RESOURCE,"Pure ore, processed through lengthy beneficiation process, ready to be refined into durable alloys.",,,
purified_rare_ore,RESOURCE,"High purity rare and heavy elements, ran through multiple separation laps to remove the isotopes that are less useful for the industry. ",,,
polymer,RESOURCE,"Advanced polymers that were made with highly refined organic matter and no less than 11 proprietary compounds and additives, tailored to specific industrial applications by teams of expert material engineers.",,,
compound,RESOURCE,"Assortment of incredibly complex molecules, ready to be used in the industries.",,,
refined_metal,RESOURCE,"Extremely durable alloys, with precisely controlled grain structure, billets and composite prefabs, made to meet even the highest expectations, from plating that forms armor of capital ships to powerful industrial equipment. These alloys sell for a high price and are critical for building a powerful fleet, requiring merchants to fulfill plenty of paperwork before being trusted with shipping these across the sector. ",,,
purified_rare_metal,RESOURCE,"Components with unmatched performance, ranging from zero stress wafers and lattices to what looks like fully autonomous diffusion systems and odd-looking alloys with unknown applications. Traces of these components were found in domain-era equipment, experimental electronics and highly advanced sensors and apparatus used in envelope-pushing research ",,,
research_databank,RESOURCE,"Not damaged by the passage of time and thus full of valuable data storage devices, all of them bearing late Domain or early Sector markings. The data inside is usually encrypted with algorithms either too resistant or otherwise requiring too much time and resources to crack and thus considered mostly unusuable by most of the factions of the Persean Sector, as they require both a set-up and know-how, both a rarity in current times. However anyone industrious or desperate enough to crack the code will have centuries worth of research records and data on their hands.",,,
bifrost_gate,CUSTOM,"An orbital structure built using technology used in the former Domainâ€™s gate network. Requiring expertise in pre-collapse technology, plentiful materials to maintain, as well as activation using the janus device, the Bifrost Gate is the closest we can get to the now dormant gate network in the Persean Sector. Due to the experimental nature of the gate and the massive strain the energy used to activate it puts on the systems, the gate will require 30 days before becoming stable enough to be used once again.",,,
